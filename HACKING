== INSTALL

Remedie is under development and requires lots of hacking.

Pull the latest code from git using git pull or github download, then run:

  > perl ./bin/remedie-server.pl

and access http://localhost:10010/ to see the app running. The logs
and app cache are stored in ~/.remedie and ~/.plagger dirctory.

You can type 'R' (shift+r) to refresh all feeds from UI. Type 'H'
(shift+h) to see the list of available keyboard shortcuts.

I hope this will eventually become standalone installable app using preferencePanes etc.

== CLEANING UP DATABASE

For now, stop the `remedie-server.pl` process by `kill` or Ctrl-C, and then

  > rm -r ~/.remedie

to clean the database, Running `remedie-server.pl` will automatically
re-initialize SQLite database. When we change the schema you might
need to do that again (and that will lose all your items in the
database!) until we come up with a decent schema upgrading system.

== DEBUGGING

Got a black screen or JavaScript alert "Can't load subscription"? Try:

  > env REMEDIE_DEBUG=1 ./bin/remedie-server.pl

and see ~/.remedie/logs/error.log for the errors. You can quick check the
perl module dependencies by running

  > ack -h ^use lib | sort -u | perl -Ilib

and we have a plan to write a full Makefile.PL and probably bundle
required modules in extlib in the future.

== TODO

See http://code.google.com/p/remedie/issues/list for current issues and TODOs.
